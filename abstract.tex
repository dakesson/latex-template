The impact of decisions on the design process is initially high and declines as the design matures. However, few computational tools are available for the early design phase; thus, an opportunity exists to create such tools. In the conventional workflow the architect uses geometric modelling tools and the engineer uses structural analysis tools in a sequential step. Parametric modeling tools are an improvement to this workflow as structural analysis plug-ins are available. This allows the architect to get structural feedback in an earlier stage, but still as a sequential step to the geometric modeling. The present work is a proposal to improve this workflow by integrating structural feedback with geometric modeling.
 
User interfaces of these tools needs to be needs to be interactive and agile enough to follow the designerâ€™s iterative workflow. Direct manipulation is a human-computer interaction style which enables interactive user interfaces. In this user interface style users can directly manipulate objects on the screen using real-world metaphors, which makes the users more engaged with their task and encouraged to further explorations. This is achieved through reducing the perceptual and cognitive resources required to understand and use the user interface. New technology opens up new possibilities to create new design tools that make use of very direct manipulation. These possibilities are further explored in this thesis through development of two such tools. 

The first application that has been developed make use of the multi-touch of tablets. The multi-touch interface literally closed the gap between human and computer, which enables a very direct manipulation interaction for two dimensional (2D) user interfaces. The developed application is an interactive conceptual design tool with real-time structural feedback that allows the user to quickly input, and modify, structural models through the use of gestures. The second application extends these concepts and ideas into a three dimensional (3D) user interface by using a 3D input device named the Leap Motion Controller. 

The present work purposes a way to integrate structural demands earlier in the design process by employing very direct manipulation user interfaces.
